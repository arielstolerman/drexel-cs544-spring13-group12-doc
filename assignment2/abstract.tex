In this paper we propose a protocol for remote smart house control. Smart houses are structures with a centralized control server, that allows controlling various functions and devices in the structure, commonly used for controlling lighting, temperature, security status, entertainment etc. The Remote SmartHouse Control protocol, RSHC, allows a remote user, the client, to log in the house, the server, and perform actions to modify the state of the house, or more precisely its devices. This document details the protocol communication definitions, and analysis of its characteristics, including extensibility, security etc.
