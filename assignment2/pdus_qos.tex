\subsection{Quality of Service}
\label{sec:pdus:qos}

The RSHCP protocol provides several services to the client to ensure that quality is present through its use. This particular protocol provides a simplicity warranted for future extensibility and version control, allowing backwards compatibility as well. Even further, the use of an authentication mechanism to ensure security of the client connecting to the server during operations is implemented during the initiation stage. Another feature of the protocol sustains the client knowledge of all household device status changes to provide the client with the most current blueprint of the SmartHouse.  These services are defined in detail elsewhere, but are the pillar of service quality in which RSHCP is determined to provide.
